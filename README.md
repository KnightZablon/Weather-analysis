Project Description:
This project focuses on leveraging weather data from the Open-Meteo API to analyze and visualize trends in temperature and wind speed for Stockholm over the course of 2023. The objective is to process raw hourly weather data, transform it into meaningful insights, and present these findings through clear visualizations. This helps in understanding weather patterns and making data-driven decisions.

Steps Taken:
1. Data Collection
API Integration: The Open-Meteo API was used to fetch hourly weather data, including temperature, rainfall, snowfall, and wind speed, for Stockholm (latitude: 59.3294, longitude: 18.0687).
Caching & Retrying: Implemented requests_cache for caching responses and retry logic for handling potential API errors, ensuring reliable data retrieval.
Custom Parameters: Configured API parameters to specify the desired weather variables and the data range (January 1, 2023, to December 31, 2023).
2. Data Transformation
Data Parsing: Extracted hourly weather data variables like temperature, wind speed, rainfall, and snowfall.
Timestamp Conversion: Converted timestamps into a pandas DataFrame with a readable date-time format.
Feature Engineering:
Added year, month, and day columns for easier aggregation.
Aggregated hourly data into daily averages using groupby() for a higher-level analysis.
3. Data Storage
Exporting Data: Saved the processed data to a CSV file for documentation and future reuse.
4. Data Analysis
Summary Metrics:
Calculated the overall average temperature (7.19°C) and wind speed (12.46 m/s) for the year.
Aggregated daily averages to analyze seasonal and monthly trends.
Key Insights:
Stockholm’s average temperature suggests a moderate climate with significant variations across seasons.
Wind speed remained steady throughout the year, averaging 12.46 m/s.
5. Data Visualization
Line Chart: Plotted hourly temperature and wind speed trends to capture short-term variations and daily fluctuations.
Bar Chart: Displayed daily average temperature and wind speed to highlight seasonal patterns.
Pie Chart: Represented the proportion of average temperature vs. wind speed to emphasize their relative contributions.
The Data Story:
Imagine the daily rhythms of Stockholm’s weather in 2023. The year begins with cold January days, where temperatures hover just above freezing, and snowfall is evident. Transitioning into spring, temperatures rise steadily, with wind speeds providing a steady pace of change. The summer months offer a glimpse of stability, with warmer temperatures and less snowfall. As autumn arrives, a gradual cooling sets in, culminating in winter’s return.

Through the visuals:

Line charts reveal how temperature and wind speed fluctuate hourly, showing bursts of windy days and temperature dips during winter nights.
Bar charts simplify these hourly intricacies into daily averages, illustrating the broader seasonal patterns.
Pie charts underscore the balance between climate factors, with temperature and wind speed playing key roles in shaping the city’s weather narrative.
Outcomes:
This project showcases the power of transforming raw weather data into actionable insights. The trends identified can aid stakeholders in:

Planning seasonal events or activities in alignment with weather conditions.
Optimizing energy usage for heating or cooling based on temperature patterns.
Leveraging wind speed data for renewable energy projects like wind turbines.
